- **Service Worker Registration** (`/src/utils/serviceWorker.js`) - Automatic service worker management
- **PWA Install Component** (`/src/components/PWAInstall.js`) - Beautiful install prompt for users
- **PWA Configuration** (`/src/config/pwa.js`) - Centralized PWA settings and features

### üåê HTML & Meta Tags

### üì± PWA Features

- **Push Notifications** - Background notification support
- **Background Sync** - Data synchronization when connection is restored
- **App Shell** - Fast loading and smooth navigation
- **Responsive Design** - Works perfectly on all device sizes

## üöÄ How to Use

### For End Users
1. **Open the app** in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox)
2. **Look for the install prompt** - it will appear automatically
3. **Click "Install"** to add the app to your device
4. **Enjoy native app experience** with offline functionality

### For Developers
1. **Start development**: `yarn start`
2. **Build for production**: `yarn build`
3. **Test PWA features**: Use the included test file
4. **Deploy**: The build folder is ready for production

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Next Steps

### 1. Replace Icon Placeholders
The current icon files are placeholders. You need to create actual PNG images:

- `/public/favicon-16x16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `/public/favicon-32x32.png` (32x32 pixels)  
- `/public/logo192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `/public/logo512.png` (512x512 pixels)
- `/public/screenshot1.png` (540x720 pixels)

**See**: `ICON_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions

### 2. Test PWA Functionality
1. Build the app: `yarn build`
2. Serve the build: `npx serve -s build`
3. Open `/test-pwa.html` to verify all features work
4. Test installation on different devices

### 3. Customize for Your Needs
- Update app name and description in `manifest.json`
- Modify theme colors in PWA configuration
- Add your own app shortcuts
- Customize notification settings

## üîç Testing Your PWA

### Built-in Test File
Use `/test-pwa.html` to verify:

### Lighthouse Audit
1. **Open DevTools** ‚Üí Lighthouse tab
